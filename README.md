# TDEEandBMRCalculator

This is a Vanilla javaScript, html, and css app for a Total Daily Energy Expenditure and Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator. This app can be used for fitness or normal eating healthy goals.

Feel free to make changes accordingly for corrections or adding to it because this is my first attempt at creating an app.

"TDEE stands for ‘Total Daily Energy Expenditure’, which is the total number of calories your body is burning each day – and, by extension, the number of calories that you’d need to eat each day to maintain your current weight."

"BMR stands for Basal metabolic Rate
It is also called the resting metabolic rate and is the amount of energy you expend in a normal resting state at normal temperature."
